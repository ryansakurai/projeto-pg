# Graphic Processing Project

The project implements the visualization of a scene from the perspective of four different cameras. The scene consists of:

- A rubber duck, loaded from an external 3D model, illuminated by directional lighting;
- Two tori (rings) whose color fluctuates between white and red (made using a custom shader), spinning around the duck at random speeds;
- Azure background.

### User Interaction

It's possible to switch between cameras using ↑ and ↓.
